        <h1>Fried Chicken</h1>

            or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried.</p>

            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <hr>
            
            <ol>
                <h2><li></h2>
                    <p>Cut the whole chickens into 4 breasts, 4 thighs, 4 legs and 4 wings and set aside.</p></li>

                    <h2><li></h2>
                    <p>Preheat your oil, in either a heavy pan on the stove or a deep-fryer, to 325 degrees F.</p></li>

                    <h2><li></h2>
                    <p>In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder 
                        and cayenne pepper until thoroughly mixed. Set aside.</p></li>

                    <h2><li></h2>
                    <p>Pour the buttermilk into another bowl large enough for the chicken to be immersed in the buttermilk.</p></li>

                    <h2><li></h2>
                    <p>Prepare your dredging station. Place your chicken in a bowl.</p>
                    
                    <p>Next to that, your bowl of buttermilk, and next to that, your dry mixture.</p></li>

                    <h2><li></h2>
                        <p>Take your breasts, lightly dust them with your flour mixture,</p> 
                        <p>then dip them in the buttermilk until they are coated, and then place them in the flour mixture.</p></li>

                    <h2><li></h2>
                        <p>Take the breasts that are in the flour mixture and aggressively push the flour mixture into the wet chicken.</p>
                        <p>Make sure that the chicken in very thoroughly coated, or you will not achieve the crust and crunch you are looking for.</p>
                        <p>Gently place the breasts in your hot oil.</p>

                    <h2><li></h2>
                        <p>Next, repeat the dredging steps with your other pieces of chicken in this order: thigh, leg then wing.</p>

                    <h2><li></h2>
                        <p>When you place the last wing into the fryer, you should have 16 pieces of chicken in the oil. Set a timer for 15 minutes.</p>

                    <h2><li></h2>
                        <p>After 15 minutes, take a probe thermometer and check the temperature of a breast.</p>
                        <p>If it reads 180 degrees F, all of your chicken is done.</p>
                        <p>(Keep in mind that it will continue to cook after it has been removed from the fryer.)</p>

                    <h2><li></h2>
                        <p>Remove the chicken from the oil and let it drain for 5 minutes.</p>
                        <p>Let cool for an additional 10 minutes before serving.</p>
            </ol>
